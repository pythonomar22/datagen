{"instruction": "Explain the concept of recursion in programming.", "response": "Recursion in programming is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. It's particularly useful for tasks that can be broken down into similar subtasks. A recursive function typically has a base case that stops the recursion and a recursive case that continues it. For example, calculating a factorial: 5! can be calculated as 5 \u00d7 4!, which is 5 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 3!, and so on until we reach the base case of 1! = 1."}
{"instruction": "What is photosynthesis and why is it important?", "response": "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy, usually from the sun, into chemical energy in the form of glucose (sugar). They use carbon dioxide and water, releasing oxygen as a byproduct. This process is crucial because it provides the oxygen we breathe, forms the base of food chains by creating energy-rich compounds, and helps regulate atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, which affects climate."}
{"instruction": "How does cloud computing work?", "response": "Cloud computing delivers various services over the internet, including storage, databases, software, and processing power. Instead of keeping files and applications on local devices, they're stored remotely on servers owned by providers like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. Users access these resources on-demand over the internet, paying only for what they use. This model provides scalability, flexibility, and cost efficiency compared to maintaining physical infrastructure."}
