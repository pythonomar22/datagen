{"instruction": "Explain quantum computing in simple terms.", "response": "Quantum computing uses the unique properties of quantum physics to process information in new ways. While regular computers use bits (0s and 1s), quantum computers use qubits that can exist in multiple states at once. This allows them to solve certain complex problems much faster than traditional computers."}
{"instruction": "Write a short poem about technology.", "response": "Silicon dreams and digital streams,\nConnecting hearts across the miles,\nIn zeros, ones, and laser beams,\nOur modern world of tech beguiles.\n\nDevices smart and always near,\nCompanions in our daily quest,\nYet simple moments we hold dear,\nRemind us humans still know best."}
