    def filter(self, results):
        # BUG: Division by zero when no examples pass filters
        # Applies all registered filters
```

## Metrics Module (Latest Addition)
The metrics module has been partially implemented in `datagen/metrics/`. Current implementation status:

## RL-Guided Data Generation Implementation (UPDATED)

### Overview
The RL-guided data generation module uses reinforcement learning to optimize synthetic data generation for a specific target model and task. It iteratively adjusts generation parameters to maximize performance metrics like accuracy or F1 score.

### Implementation Details

#### Core Components
- **RLTuner Class**: Main class implementing the RL loop:
  - Manages the optimization process
  - Tracks the best parameters found
  - Maintains a history of iterations and results
  - Provides methods to generate data with optimized parameters
  - Allows saving and loading optimization state

- **RLTuningConfig**: Configuration for RL-guided generation:
  - Parameters for the RL algorithm (iterations, batch size, etc.)
  - Bounds for sampling parameters (temperature, top_p)
  - Generation methods to explore
  - Reward metric to optimize
  - Policy gradient specific parameters (NEW)

- **Agents Module**: Implements different RL algorithms (NEW)
  - `BaseAgent`: Abstract base class defining the agent interface
  - `RandomSearchAgent`: Basic agent that randomly samples parameters
  - `REINFORCEAgent`: Policy gradient agent that learns parameter selection

- **PolicyNetwork**: Neural network for the policy gradient approach (NEW)
  - Handles both continuous actions (temperature, top_p) and discrete actions (generation method)
  - Provides probability distributions for action selection
  - Learns from reward signals to improve parameter selection

- **Target Model Interface**: 
  - Flexible callback function that evaluates synthetic data
  - Must return a dictionary of metrics including the reward metric

#### Optimization Process
1. At each iteration, the RLTuner:
   - Samples new parameters using the selected RL algorithm
   - Updates generator settings
   - Generates synthetic data
   - Evaluates it using the target model
   - Updates the best parameters if performance improves
   - Updates the agent's policy (for policy gradient)
   - Records history

2. After optimization, the RLTuner can:
   - Generate synthetic data using the best parameters
   - Save the optimization state for later use
   - Provide analysis of the optimization process

### Policy Gradient Implementation (NEW)
We've implemented the REINFORCE algorithm, a policy gradient method:

1. **State Representation**:
   - Previous reward
   - Current temperature and top_p settings

2. **Action Space**:
   - Continuous: temperature and top_p parameters (handled as normal distributions)
   - Discrete: generation method (handled as a categorical distribution)

3. **Policy Network**:
   - A small neural network with a shared feature extraction layer
   - Specialized output heads for continuous and discrete actions
   - Produces means and standard deviations for continuous actions
   - Produces logits for discrete actions

4. **Learning Process**:
   - Collects trajectories of states, actions, and rewards
   - Calculates discounted returns with configurable discount factor
   - Updates policy to increase the probability of actions that led to good rewards
   - Supports normalization of rewards for stable training

5. **Advantages over Random Search**:
   - Learns from past experience instead of random sampling
   - Can adapt to different task requirements
   - Generally converges faster to optimal parameters
   - More efficient for complex parameter spaces

#### Current Limitations
- Requires PyTorch for the policy gradient implementation
- Falls back to random search if PyTorch is not available
- Training stability depends on hyperparameter selection
- Requires more iterations than random search to realize benefits

## Immediate Technical Tasks with Implementation Guidance

### 1. Add Visualization Module for Metrics
Create file `datagen/metrics/visualization.py` with these functions referenced in `__init__.py`:
```python
def create_length_distribution_plot(dataset, stats, save_path=None):
    # Create histogram of instruction and response lengths
    # Use matplotlib

def create_topic_distribution_plot(topics, save_path=None):
    # Create bar chart of topic weights
    # Use matplotlib

def create_readability_plot(readability_scores, save_path=None):
    # Create bar or radar chart of readability metrics
    # Use matplotlib

def create_diversity_plot(diversity_metrics, save_path=None):
    # Create visualization of n-gram diversity
    # Use matplotlib

def create_perplexity_plot(perplexity_scores, save_path=None):
    # Create histogram of perplexity scores
    # Use matplotlib
    
def create_summary_dashboard(metrics, save_path=None):
    # Create multi-panel figure summarizing key metrics
    # Use matplotlib subplot grid
```

### 2. Add Controlled Generation to Generator Class
Add method to `generator.py`:
```python
def generate_with_constraints(self, instructions, constraints, examples_per_instruction=1):
    """
    Generate content with domain, style and other constraints.
    
    Args:
        instructions: List of instructions to generate from
        constraints: Dict with constraints including:
                     - domain: Domain name (e.g., "legal", "medical")
                     - keywords: List of domain-specific keywords
                     - style: Style descriptor (e.g., "formal", "conversational")
                     - tone: Tone descriptor (e.g., "authoritative", "friendly")
                     - complexity: Complexity level (e.g., "high", "medium", "low")
        examples_per_instruction: Number of examples to generate per instruction
        
    Returns:
        Results object containing generated examples with constraints
    """
    # Implementation should use prompt engineering to enforce constraints
    # See controlled_generation.py example for expected behavior
```

### 3. Add Data Augmentation Methods
Add these methods to `generator.py`:
```python
def augment_by_paraphrasing(self, examples, variations_per_example=2, fields_to_paraphrase=None):
    """Generates paraphrased variations of examples"""
    # Implementation using instruction prompting for paraphrasing

def augment_with_style_variation(self, examples, styles, examples_per_style=1):
    """Generates style variations of examples"""
    # Implementation using style transfer prompting
    
def augment_with_domain_transfer(self, examples, target_domains, examples_per_domain=1):
    """Adapts examples to different domains"""
    # Implementation using domain adaptation prompting
```

### 4. Fix Quality Filter Division by Zero Bug
In `quality/filter.py`, update the `filter` method to handle the case when all examples are filtered out:
```python
def filter(self, results):
    original_count = len(results)
    if original_count == 0:
        logger.warning("Empty results provided for filtering.")
        return results
        
    # Apply filters
    # ...
    
    filtered_count = len(results)
    removed_count = original_count - filtered_count
    
    # Fix division by zero error
    retention_rate = 100.0 if original_count == 0 else (filtered_count / original_count * 100)
    logger.info(f"Filtering completed in {end_time-start_time:.2f}s. Kept {filtered_count}/{original_count} examples ({retention_rate:.1f}%)")
    
    return results
```

## Outstanding Tasks

### Implementations Needed
1. **Visualization Module**: Need to implement the visualization module for metrics.
