# DataGen Library - Technical Status Report

## Project Overview
DataGen is a specialized Python library for generating high-quality synthetic text datasets for LLM training. The project is currently in active development with several core modules implemented but others still in conceptual or partial implementation stages.

## Implementation Status (Detailed)

### Core Components
| Component | Status | Implementation Details |
|-----------|--------|------------------------|
| Generator Class | ✓ Implemented | Core methods `generate_from_seed()` and `evolve_instructions()` are functional. API key validation exists but needs expansion. |
| Config System | ✓ Implemented | Complete nested configuration system with default values. |
| Results Class | ✓ Implemented | Full implementation including save/load, filtering, and pandas conversion. |
| Quality Filtering | ⚠️ Partial | Basic filters implemented. Division by zero error exists when no examples pass filters. |
| Privacy Features | ⚠️ Partial | Basic content filtering is implemented. Differential privacy is mostly placeholder. |
| Data Pipeline | ⚠️ Partial | IO utilities work but advanced transformation pipelines are incomplete. |
| CLI Module | ❌ Placeholder | Currently minimal implementation that demonstrates conceptual interface. |
| Metrics Module | ⚠️ Incomplete | Core metrics implemented, but missing visualization module. |

### Generation Methods
| Method | Status | Implementation Details |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| Self-Instruct | ✓ Implemented | Fully functional with OpenAI backend. |
| Evol-Instruct | ✓ Implemented | Functional but limited to simple evolution patterns. |
| Template Generation | ✓ Implemented | Basic implementation with variable substitution. |
| Controlled Generation | ❌ Not Implemented | Example exists but core method is missing from Generator class. |
| Domain-Specific | ❌ Not Implemented | Example exists but underlying implementation missing. |
| Data Augmentation | ❌ Not Implemented | Example shows conceptual API but methods don't exist. |

### Metrics Module (Latest Addition)
The metrics module has been partially implemented in `datagen/metrics/`. Current implementation status:

| File | Status | Implementation Details |
|------|--------|------------------------|
| `__init__.py` | ✓ Implemented | Main interface calling all submodules with error handling. |
| `basic_stats.py` | ✓ Implemented | Full implementation with all features. |
| `diversity.py` | ✓ Implemented | Complete with fallbacks for missing dependencies. |
| `perplexity.py` | ✓ Implemented | Complete implementation using transformers (optional dependency). |
| `readability.py` | ✓ Implemented | Complete with support for multiple readability metrics. |
| `topic_modeling.py` | ✓ Implemented | Complete with support for LDA, BERTopic, and frequency-based analysis. |
| `visualization.py` | ❌ Missing | Referenced in `__init__.py` but file doesn't exist. |

The visualization module should create plots for:
- Length distributions
- Topic distributions
- Readability scores
- Diversity metrics
- Perplexity distributions 
- Summary dashboard

## Code Structure and Implementation Details

### Generator Class (`generator.py`)
```python
class Generator:
    def __init__(self, config=None):
        # Config initialization and validation
        
    def generate_from_seed(self, seed_examples, count, method="self_instruct"):
        # Validates API key if using OpenAI
        # Currently supports "self_instruct" method
        # Returns Results object
        
    def evolve_instructions(self, instructions, rounds=1):
        # Evolves instructions through specified rounds
        # Returns Results object with evolved instructions
        
    # MISSING METHODS that examples reference:
    # def generate_with_constraints()
    # def generate_from_template()
    # def augment_by_paraphrasing()
    # def augment_with_style_variation()
    # def augment_with_domain_transfer()
```

### Config System (`config.py`)
```python
class Config:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sampling = SamplingConfig()
        self.quality = QualityConfig()
        self.privacy = PrivacyConfig()
        self.generation = GenerationConfig()
        self.output_format = "jsonl"
        self.api_keys = {}
        self.log_level = "INFO"
        
    # Missing: MetricsConfig - referenced in examples but not implemented
```

### Quality Filtering (`quality/filter.py`)
```python
class QualityFilter:
    def __init__(self, config):
        self.config = config
        self.filters = [
            self.filter_min_length,
            self.filter_max_length,
            self.filter_instruction_min_length,
            self.filter_response_min_length,
            self.filter_duplicate_content,
            # More filters can be registered at runtime
        ]
    
    def register_filter(self, filter_fn):
        # Allows custom filter registration
        
    def filter(self, results):
        # BUG: Division by zero when no examples pass filters
        # Applies all registered filters
```

## Immediate Technical Tasks with Implementation Guidance

### 1. Add Visualization Module for Metrics
Create file `datagen/metrics/visualization.py` with these functions referenced in `__init__.py`:
```python
def create_length_distribution_plot(dataset, stats, save_path=None):
    # Create histogram of instruction and response lengths
    # Use matplotlib

def create_topic_distribution_plot(topics, save_path=None):
    # Create bar chart of topic weights
    # Use matplotlib

def create_readability_plot(readability_scores, save_path=None):
    # Create bar or radar chart of readability metrics
    # Use matplotlib

def create_diversity_plot(diversity_metrics, save_path=None):
    # Create visualization of n-gram diversity
    # Use matplotlib

def create_perplexity_plot(perplexity_scores, save_path=None):
    # Create histogram of perplexity scores
    # Use matplotlib
    
def create_summary_dashboard(metrics, save_path=None):
    # Create multi-panel figure summarizing key metrics
    # Use matplotlib subplot grid
```

### 2. Add Controlled Generation to Generator Class
Add method to `generator.py`:
```python
def generate_with_constraints(self, instructions, constraints, examples_per_instruction=1):
    """
    Generate content with domain, style and other constraints.
    
    Args:
        instructions: List of instructions to generate from
        constraints: Dict with constraints including:
                     - domain: Domain name (e.g., "legal", "medical")
                     - keywords: List of domain-specific keywords
                     - style: Style descriptor (e.g., "formal", "conversational")
                     - tone: Tone descriptor (e.g., "authoritative", "friendly")
                     - complexity: Complexity level (e.g., "high", "medium", "low")
        examples_per_instruction: Number of examples to generate per instruction
        
    Returns:
        Results object containing generated examples with constraints
    """
    # Implementation should use prompt engineering to enforce constraints
    # See controlled_generation.py example for expected behavior
```

### 3. Add Data Augmentation Methods
Add these methods to `generator.py`:
```python
def augment_by_paraphrasing(self, examples, variations_per_example=2, fields_to_paraphrase=None):
    """Generates paraphrased variations of examples"""
    # Implementation using instruction prompting for paraphrasing

def augment_with_style_variation(self, examples, styles, examples_per_style=1):
    """Generates style variations of examples"""
    # Implementation using style transfer prompting
    
def augment_with_domain_transfer(self, examples, target_domains, examples_per_domain=1):
    """Adapts examples to different domains"""
    # Implementation using domain adaptation prompting
```

### 4. Fix Quality Filter Division by Zero Bug
In `quality/filter.py`, update the `filter` method to handle the case when all examples are filtered out:
```python
def filter(self, results):
    original_count = len(results)
    if original_count == 0:
        logger.warning("Empty results provided for filtering.")
        return results
        
    # Apply filters
    # ...
    
    filtered_count = len(results)
    removed_count = original_count - filtered_count
    
    # Fix division by zero error
    retention_rate = 100.0 if original_count == 0 else (filtered_count / original_count * 100)
    logger.info(f"Filtering completed in {end_time-start_time:.2f}s. Kept {filtered_count}/{original_count} examples ({retention_rate:.1f}%)")
    
    return results
```

## Dependencies and Environment

### Required Dependencies
```
openai>=0.27.0
pandas>=1.3.0
numpy>=1.20.0
tqdm>=4.62.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0
matplotlib>=3.4.0
```

### Optional Dependencies
```
transformers>=4.20.0  # For perplexity calculation
sentence-transformers>=2.2.0  # For semantic diversity
nltk>=3.6.0  # For text analysis
gensim>=4.1.0  # For topic modeling (LDA)
bertopic>=0.13.0  # For advanced topic modeling
```

## Testing

The codebase currently lacks:
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- CI/CD setup

A priority should be establishing test coverage for the core modules, starting with:
1. Generator API tests
2. Quality filter tests
3. Metrics calculation tests

## Conclusion

The DataGen library has solid foundations with working core functionality, but several features demonstrated in examples are aspirational and need implementation. The metrics module is nearly complete but requires the visualization component. The most immediate task is adding the visualization module, followed by implementing the controlled generation and data augmentation methods.
