      "instruction": "Explain the concept of neural networks.",
      "response": "Neural networks are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks in human brains. They consist of layers of interconnected nodes or 'neurons' that process information. Each connection can transmit a signal from one neuron to another, activated by the input it receives. The network learns by adjusting the strengths of these connections based on the data it processes."

      "instruction": "What is the difference between machine learning and deep learning?",
      "response": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn from data and improve without explicit programming. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks with many layers (hence 'deep'). While traditional machine learning requires feature extraction by humans, deep learning can automatically discover the representations needed for detection or classification from raw data."
