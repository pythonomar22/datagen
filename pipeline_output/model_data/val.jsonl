{"instruction": "Explain the concept of quantum computing.", "response": "Quantum computing is a cutting-edge technology that leverages the principles of quantum mechanics to perform calculations at speeds exponentially faster than classical computers. Instead of using bits, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously. Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields such as cryptography, optimization, and drug discovery.", "source": "self_instruct", "batch": 0}
